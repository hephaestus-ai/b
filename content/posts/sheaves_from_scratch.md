# Sheaves from Scratch

In this post I build sheaves from "scratch", at least from the point of view of set theory, starting from primitive notions such as the succession operator and climbing up a ladder of objects until sheaves come into view. I have tried to keep it relatively comprehensible to anyone with at least an understanding of basic set theory, spending time focusing especially on the "what" and "why", while keeping the detailed "how" separate and mostly non-essential.

This information was put together in response to a question in a Discord private conversation. I haven't seen a "from scratch" definition of sheaves anywhere, so I thought this might be useful. I often call these sorts of maximalist definitions "groundworks." I’d already laid most of it out across notes and messages, so assembling it all wasn’t too much work, despite the length.

I may break this post up later. As you will see, we build many other things from scratch as we work our way up to sheaves. Future posts may address schemes, manifolds, and other objects, since, once you understand sheaves, you're already much of the way to understanding how a large number of other complex objects are constructed. Future posts may also touch on various collections of implications one can derive from these definitions that are interesting.
