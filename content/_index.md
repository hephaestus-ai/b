**Welcome** to my personal blog, a place in which I dump some random thoughts, various explanations I believe others may find helpful, and (eventually) longer form books. Who am I? For the time being, I prefer to maintain anonymity. But suffice it to say, I am a technologist with expertise in software engineering, machine learning, and mathematics. When I step away from work I like to focus on topics such as economics, culture, politics, culture, history, and strategy.

**In** a previous life, I was a tutor for an affluent clientele, a role that taught me the value of breaking down complex problems and presenting explanations in understandable, memorable ways.

**You** can browse by starting with the [Spotlight](#spotlight) below, or if that doesnâ€™t grab you, the [Posts](posts/) archive holds everything else; tags can be used to organize the content.

**Longer** work lives under [Books](books/), still in progress, so expect scaffolding and gaps. You can check back soon.

**Thereâ€™s** a light switch in the menu if the theme annoys you.

**If** you spot an error, want to connect, or just feel like arguing, you can [Contact](contact/) me.

**That's** about it for now. I hope you find something worthwhile here.
